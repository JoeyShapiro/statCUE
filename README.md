i could maybe do frag shader, but i think it would be shoe horning. wouldnt be as fast.
compute shaders literally do what i want, it has compute in the name.
i could do shaders for something else

could do cuda or glsl style, but really this will only run on windows
corsair only supports windows and mac,
and the parts i use are only for PC (windows or linux)
so windows only
so i will use HLSL and Direct X

## TODO
- handle multiple devices
- change color range to 0 - 1
- let the user set the "fps" and other stuff in the shader file
